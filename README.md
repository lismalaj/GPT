# Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT)

**Language Models are Few-Shot Learners** [[PAPER]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf) [[OpenAI Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/)

A minimal Pytorch implementation of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). GPT is a decorder only model which is based on the original transformer model (Vaswani, et al. _"Attention Is All You Need"_). This repository implements a simple version of GPT-3. The code is written as clearly as possible so that it is easy to understand.

## Brief Explanation of Architecture

The GPT model is composed of a bunch of layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer can be thought of as a transformer block. The transformer block is itself made up by few components, Masked Multi Head Self Attention Layer, Point Wise Feed Forward Layer, and Layer Norms.

Inputs to the transformers are first passed through an Embedding layer which is learnable. Because the transformers are position invariant, meaning transfomers does not maintain the order of words in input data, we need to add the positional encodings to our embedded data to introduce ordering in inputs.

### Masked Multi Head Self Attention

The inputs are first passed to this layer. The inputs are split into key, query and value pairs. Key, query and values are linearly projected using a MLP layer. Key and Queries are multiplied and scaled to generate the attention scores. This attention score is then multiplied with the value followed by a linear projection to generate output.

</p>

To increase capactiy of the model, we use multiple of such scaled attention heads. The output from all the heads are concatenated and projected to form output of this layer.

Since GPT is a decoder only transformer, a mask is used to prevent the model from attending to future tokens. The model is only allowed to attend to the current token and all the previous tokens. This prevents the model from "cheating".

The code for this layer is given below :

```python
class SelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config: GPTconfig) -> None:
        super(SelfAttention, self).__init__()

        self.embd_size = config.embd_size
        self.n_heads = config.n_heads

        assert self.embd_size % self.n_heads == 0, f"d_model({config.embd_size}) must be divisible by n_heads({config.n_heads})."

        self.key = nn.Linear(config.embd_size, config.embd_size)
        self.query = nn.Linear(config.embd_size, config.embd_size)
        self.value = nn.Linear(config.embd_size, config.embd_size)

        self.projection = nn.Linear(config.embd_size, config.embd_size)

        self.attn_drop = nn.Dropout(config.attn_drop)
        self.resid_drop = nn.Dropout(config.resid_drop)

        self.register_buffer("mask", torch.tril(torch.ones(config.block_size, config.block_size)).view(1,1,config.block_size, config.block_size))


    def forward(self, x) -> torch.Tensor:
        B,T,C = x.size()

        # shape of k,q,v would be (batch_size, n_heads, block_size, hs)
        k = self.key(x).view(B, T, self.n_heads, C // self.n_heads).transpose(1,2)
        q = self.query(x).view(B, T, self.n_heads, C // self.n_heads).transpose(1,2)
        v = self.value(x).view(B, T, self.n_heads, C // self.n_heads).transpose(1,2)

        # (batch_size, n_heads, block_size, hs) x (batch_size, n_heads, hs, block_size) -> (batch_size, n_heads, block_size, block_size)
        attn = (q @ k.transpose(2,3)) / sqrt(k.size(-1))
        attn = attn.masked_fill(self.mask[:,:,:T,:T] == 0, float('-inf'))
        attn = F.softmax(attn, dim=-1)
        attn = self.attn_drop(attn)

        # (batch_size, n_heads, block_size, block_size) x (batch_size, n_heads, block_size, hs) -> (batch_size, n_heads, block_size, hs)
        y = attn @ v
        y = y.transpose(1,2).contiguous().view(B, T, C) L

        y = self.projection(y)
        y = self.resid_drop(y)

        return y
```

### Point Wise Feed Forward Layer

This layer takes in the normalized output of the self attention layer. It performs a linear projection over the inputs to form a larger hidden representation and then projection back to the original dimensions.

The GPT models use an expansion rate of 4 times the input dimensions. The output of this layer is then passed through a LayerNorm. GELU activation is used with the output of first projection. Optionally, dropout is used on the output of the layer.

Code for this layer is given below :

```python
class PointWiseFeedForward(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, config: GPTconfig) -> None:
        super().__init__()

        self.mlp = nn.Sequential(
                                nn.Linear(config.embd_size, config.embd_size * 4),
                                nn.GELU(),
                                nn.Linear(config.embd_size * 4, config.embd_size),
                                nn.Dropout(config.resid_drop)
                                )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.mlp(x)
```

### Transformer Block

Using the above two layers, we can now form the transformer block. Each of the above two layers is referred to as a sublayer. Residual connections (He, et al. _"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"_) are employed in between the sublayers. LayerNorm is used for normalization.

Code for the transformer block is given below :

```python
class Block(nn.Module):

    def __init__(self, config: GPTconfig) -> None:
        super().__init__()

        self.attn = SelfAttention(config)

        self.ln1 = nn.LayerNorm(config.embd_size)
        self.ln2 = nn.LayerNorm(config.embd_size)

        self.mlp = PointWiseFeedForward(config)

    def forward(self, x) -> torch.Tensor:
        x = self.ln1(x + self.attn(x))
        x = self.ln2(x + self.mlp(x))
        return x
```

This block is now repeated `N` times to form the complete GPT model.
